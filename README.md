I used Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region
the followig formulas were used

AVERAGE SALES OF GLOVES			200.0673854	 =AVERAGEIF(C2:C9922,C7,H2:H9922)
AVERAGE SALES OF HAT			158.8121547	 =AVERAGEIF(C2:C9922,C4,H2:H9922)
AVERAGE SALES OF JACKET			139.9395161	 =AVERAGEIF(C2:C9922,C6,H2:H9922)
AVERAGE SALES OF SHIRT			326.5635508	 =AVERAGEIF(C2:C9922,C8,H2:H9922)
AVERAGE SALES OF SHOES			308.6663312	 =AVERAGEIF(C2:C9922,C3,H2:H9922)
AVERAGE SALES OF SOCKS			121.8227763	 ==AVERAGEIF(C2:C9922,C5,H2:H9922)
				
TOTAL REVENUE IN THE  EAST			485925	 =SUMIF(D2:D9922,D4,H2:H9922)
TOTAL REVENUE IN THE  NORTH			387000	 =SUMIF(D2:D9922,D6,H2:H9922)
TOTAL REVENUE IN THE SOUTH			927820	 =SUMIF(D2:D9922,D3,H2:H9922)
TOTAL REVENUE IN THE WEST			300285	 =SUMIF(D2:D9922,D5,H2:H9922)

- Data Exploration
![msexcel capstone sales data 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cb5c483-3e69-494e-aaa0-1e980ac66689)
  
I used pivot tables to Perform an initial exploration of the sales data in order to, summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
I also created other interesting report

![msexcel capstone customer data 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4700a1c7-5e7c-4c9c-be43-50f336180926)

I used excel formulas to calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular 
subscription types using the following formulas
Average subcription duration	365.3498387	 =AVERAGE(I2:I33788)					
							
SubscriptionType							
PREMIUM	8446	 =COUNTIF(D2:D33788,D3)					
STANDARD	8420	 =COUNTIF(D2:D33788,D5)					
BASIC	16921	 =COUNTIF(D2:D33788,D4)					
							
Highest Subscription Type = BASIC							
							
	AVERAGE SALES OF BASIC SUBSCRIPTION					1996.142958	 =AVERAGEIF(D2:D33788,D4,H2:H33788)
	AVERAGE SALES OF STANDARD SUBSCRIPTION					2002.895012	 =AVERAGEIF(D2:D33788,D5,H2:H33788)
	AVERAGE SALES OF PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION					2000.836372	 =AVERAGEIF(D2:D33788,D3,H2:H33788)
							
	TOTAL REVENUE IN THE  EAST			16958763	 =SUMIF(C2:C33788,C4,H2:H33788)
